# 💼 Project 1 – A Network Intrusion
**Course:** CST 640 – Digital Forensics Technology and Practices (UMGC)  
**Author:** Niknaz Sadehvandi  
**Date:** January 30, 2025  

---

## 🧩 Overview
This project demonstrates a **network intrusion simulation** in a controlled digital forensics lab using **MARS Linux and Windows systems**.  
It investigates vulnerabilities, Base64-encoded passwords, and server misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access.

---

## 🧠 Tools and Technologies
- Kali Linux (MARS)
- Windows Server (IIS)
- Dirb, Nmap, Nikto
- CyberChef (for Base64 decoding)
- `net user` and `net localgroup` commands

---

## ⚙️ Key Findings
- Hidden directories exposed through `dirb` scan  
- Misconfigured IIS web server allowed Base64 credential exposure  
- Importance of strict access rules and regular audits highlighted

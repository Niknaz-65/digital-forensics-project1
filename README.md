## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **PowerPoint presentation** that explores a simulated **network intrusion investigation** in a controlled digital forensics lab (MARS environment).  
It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities, decoding Base64-encoded passwords, and correcting web server misconfigurations to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- 🐧 Kali Linux (MARS)
- 💻 Windows Server (IIS)
- 🔍 Dirb | Nmap | Nikto
- 🧮 CyberChef (for Base64 decoding)
- ⚙️ `net user` and `net localgroup` commands

---

## ⚙️ Key Objectives
1. Analyze a vulnerable IIS web server configuration.  
2. Perform reconnaissance using Dirb to locate hidden directories.  
3. Decode exposed Base64 credentials to reveal user information.  
4. Apply mitigation techniques to strengthen server security.
